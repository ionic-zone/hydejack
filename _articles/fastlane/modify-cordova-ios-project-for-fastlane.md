# Modify your Cordova iOS project for Fastlane

Unfortunately the default Xcode project file generated by Cordova is not ready for usage in Fastlane.

If you built an iOS app manually before, you know that by default the codesigning is not set and has to be edited manually in Xcode. // Same for build numbering. TODO Huh? // This of course won't work for this automated process, so we have to do additional things in our lane to fix this. 

When we try to do this however we will see that the xcodeproj file generated by Cordova is too old for the current tools. To fix this you can either open the project once in Xcode which will upgrade it to a more recent version. Or you can install a fastlane plugin and use this lane:

```
desc "Upgrade the Cordova project to Xcode 8"
	lane :upgrade_xcode do
        TODO ... bla upgrade xcode to 8
end
```

Then run `fastlane ios upgrade_xcode` and confirm the prompt.

Now we can continue to fix the signing and versioning stuff:

```
TODO code signing stuff (lane in stromz√§hler I think?)
```
// END TODO
