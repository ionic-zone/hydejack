## Example project on GitHub

You can also cheat a bit and take a look at this example project on GitHub. It includes all the things generated by following the above steps:

[https://github.com/ionic-zone/ionic-fastlane](https://github.com/ionic-zone/ionic-fastlane)

The README also explains what to do to get it working locally, and links to the (automatically generated) `fastlane` README that lists all the functionality available.
