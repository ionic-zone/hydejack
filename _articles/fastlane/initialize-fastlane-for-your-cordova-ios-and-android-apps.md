# Initialize Fastlane for your (Cordova) iOS and Android apps

Now that `fastlane` is installed you can initialize it into your Ionic project:

## Initialize with `fastlane init`

Initialization of the actual Fastlane installation in your project happens by running `fastlane init` on the command line. Be aware that this will trigger quite some errors as we are doing this in a non-standard way. We will start with iOS:

### iOS

Now you can run `fastlane init` in your project folder (where your `config.xml` and `/platforms` directory exist). As we don't run this in a default iOS project, it can't automatically detect the platform and will ask you if this is actually an iOS project, which you confirm with `y`. 

![`fastlane init`]({{ site.url }}/assets/fastlane/fastlane-init-1.png)

It also can't automatically find the "project file", so enter `platforms/ios/FastlaneIonic.xcodeproj` (Replace "FastlaneIonic" with the actual file name that depends on the `name` you set in your `config.xml` - best check for the file name in the file system).

Then it asks for your Apple ID that will be used to log in to iTunes Connect and the associated password, which it will store in your system's keychain via [fastlane's credential manager](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/credentials_manager). (Entering this will (of course) trigger your two-factor-authentication that you also have to enter on the command line)

Because of an [incompatibility of Fastlane with Cordova iOS projects](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/10202) it currently can't automatically get your app identifier (called `bundle_id` in iOS land) and you have to input it manually: `zone.ionic.fastlane` for this example.

If the login is successful it will ask if you would "like to create your app on iTunes Connect and the Developer Portal?". For now decline this with `n` (as we will do this later when we [Create the app remotely](create-your-app-remotely-with-fastlane.md)). The optional scheme input can be skipped by hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> - and that's it.

If you check your project's Git working copy it now includes the following files and folders:

```
fastlane/
├── Appfile
├── Fastfile
└── actions/
```

`Fastfile` is a generic (iOS only) example of possible lanes, but `Appfile` already contains your actual app information:

```
app_identifier "zone.ionic.fastlane" # The bundle identifier of your app
apple_id "piotrowski@gmail.com" # Your Apple email address

team_id "4Z338HBBX3" # Developer Portal Team ID
```

On to Android do the same for Android:

### Android

As the file structure for Fastlane was already created, and `fastlane` wasn't made for projects with both Android and iOS, we unfortuinately can't just run `init` again and choose `n` on the `iOS?` question to trigger the generation of the Android data.

But lucky for us the Android process only creates minimal content on both `Fastfile` and `Appfile` which we can replicate manually with little effort.

#### Add Android to `Fastfile` and `Appfile` 

First your add an empty `json_key_file` entry and `package_name` entry with the same value as `app_identifier` to the bottom of the `Appfile`:

```
[...]
json_key_file "" # Path to the json secret file - Follow https://github.com/fastlane/supply#setup to get one
package_name "zone.ionic.fastlane" # e.g. com.krausefx.app
```

The file listed as `json_key_file` will contain similar information to your `apple_id` and `team_id` (and username and password) for accessing an API and be defined later in the process.

Add an additional set of default `android` lanes at the end of the `Fastfile`:

```
[...]

platform :android do
  before_all do
    # ENV["SLACK_URL"] = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
  end

  desc "Runs all the tests"
  lane :test do
    gradle(task: "test")
  end

  desc "Submit a new Beta Build to Crashlytics Beta"
  lane :beta do
    gradle(task: "assembleRelease")
    crashlytics

    # sh "your_script.sh"
    # You can also use other beta testing services here
  end

  desc "Deploy a new version to the Google Play"
  lane :deploy do
    gradle(task: "assembleRelease")
    supply
  end

  # You can define as many lanes as you want

  after_all do |lane|
    # This block is called, only if the executed lane was successful

    # slack(
    #   message: "Successfully deployed new App Update."
    # )
  end

  error do |lane, exception|
    # slack(
    #   message: exception.message,
    #   success: false
    # )
  end
end
```

#### Setup authentication

First step is to setup authentication. There is no simple email + password login mechanism for the Google Play Console API, so you will have to follow these quite elaborate instructions to get a `google_play_key.json` file:
[https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/#collect-your-google-credentials](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/#collect-your-google-credentials) 

Move your `google_play_key.json` file to the same folder your whole Ionic project is in (note that it is not under version control there!) and edit your `Appfile`:

```
json_key_file "../google_play_key.json"
```

#### Test authentication

Now you can run `fastlane supply init --verbose` to test if this setup actually works:

![`fastlane supply init` to test API]({{ site.url }}/assets/fastlane/fastlane-supply-init-api-test.png)

You want to see `Fetching a new access token from Google...` and then a error `Google Api Error: applicationNotFound: No application was found for the given package name`. This means the API authentication was successful (and it failed because of other things, that we will fix in the next steps).

## Current State

Now we have a `fastlane` folder with an `Appfile` that contains information about both our apps and a `Fastfile` with some example lanes for both platforms. You also have an empty `actions` folder for filling later and your Apple ID password is saved in your keychain for later usage.
