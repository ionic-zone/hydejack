# Fastlane + Ionic: iOS Screenshots with `snapshot`

Using `fastlane snapshot`, the fastlane tool to create iOS screenshots, is a bit more complicated for Ionic apps than for normal iOS apps. Normally you "Add the ./SnapshotHelper.swift to your UI Test target" and then write **UITests** in your Xcode project. 

But with Ionic/Cordova this of course would mean that this file, the adding of it and also the UITests itself would get lost on each new checkout or project regeneration of the Cordova iOS project.

## `ionic_integration` plugin


Lucky for us someone wrote a [nice fastlane plugin called `ionic_integration`](https://github.com/knocknarea/fastlane-plugin-ionic_integration) that takes works around these limitatoin: It places these files and the tests inside the `fastlane` folder and offers a fastlane action to "retrofit" these into the Xcode project. So when the project gets newly checked out or regenerated, just run that action to add the files safely stored in git back to your Cordova iOS project.

## Steps to take screenshots

* Start with `fastlane snapshot init` which creates a `Snapfile` in `/fastlane`.
```
TODO Snapfile
```
* Uncomment some devices and add your supported languages. Also uncomment the `clear_previous_screenshots` line
* Run `fastlane add_plugin ionic_integration`to install the plugin.
* Execute `fastlane run ionic_ios_config_snapshot ionic_scheme_name:"ionic-screen-shots"` on the command line to trigger the file generation of the plugin at `fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests/ionic-screen-shots`. (This automatically retrofitted the files to your current Cordova Xcode project)
* Open your Xcode project and open the file `ionic-screen-shots/ui-snapshots.swift` (which is a generated file from the folder before, linked into your Xcode project)
* Go into the `testSnapshots` method and write your UI tests (For now it should be enough to capture a screenshot of the app after it started - which the file does in its current state.)
* Create a new lane in your `Fastfile` which contains the following call:
```
snapshot(
  output_simulator_logs: true,
  reinstall_app: false,
  erase_simulator: true,
  scheme: "ionic-screen-shots"
)
```
This executes the UITest on all devices in all languages defined in `Snapfile` and then saves these screenshots in the `fastlane/screenshots` folder.
* Another upload of metadata with `fastlane deliver` will use and upload these screenshots.


## Write more UITest tests

Writing stable UITest tests for your Cordova/Ionic app is a whole another topic and out of scope here.
