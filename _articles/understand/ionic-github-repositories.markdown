# An Overview of Ionic's Github Repositories
{:.no_toc}

If you develop applications using Ionic Framework you will - sooner or later - come into contact with one of its Github repositories. When looking for how to do something, it is sometimes easier to look into and search the code directly on Github where it is versioned and easily searchable, than to limit yourself to what you have available locally. Fortunately, all components of Ionic are developed in the open. At the latest when something doesn't work as expected and it really isn't user error, you end up at the issue's of the project or even submitting a Pull Request fixing the bug you encountered.

But Ionic (or better [ionic-team](https://github.com/ionic-team), the Github organization that hosts and collects all the repositories) has a loooot of Github repositories. More than 150 in fact. What is which and needed why?

This post gives you an overview of all these repositories. For that, I went through all of them, grouped them and added some description and explanation:

* toc
{:toc}


Let's start with the most important ones:

## General

* [ionic-cli](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) - The _Ionic Command Line Interface `ionic` (CLI)_ is what everybody that works with Ionic installs as one of the first steps with `npm install -g ionic`. It is what enables you to `ionic start` projects, `ionic serve` them in the local browser to test them and `ionic cordova build` them into Cordova wrapped native apps for mobile - and so much more.

* [ionic-site](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-site) - You most probably visited _[ionicframework.com](https://ionicframework.com)_ when you learned about Ionic Framework. Here is all the information you need, including the [complete documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/). The site is built from this repository, which in turn gets its content from many of the child repositories.

## Ionic

Note: What I call just "Ionic" in the following paragraphs and lists was formerly known as Ionic 2. But Ionic quickly followed up with Ionic 3 and is working hard on the next iterations - so it makes more sense to call is just Ionic. The older iteration of the Framework that was built on AngularJS (instead of Angular for the current Ionic) is now known as "[Ionic v1](#ionic-v1)" and referred as such here.
{:.message}

* [ionic](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic) - This is the main _Ionic Framework_ repository that is published as `ionic-angular` to npm and by this name included in the `package.json` of newly created Ionic projects. It includes... TODO

* [ionic-app-scripts](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts) - Ionic _App Scripts_ are "App Build Scripts for Ionic Projects". They are used by the Ionic CLI to do everything that is required to go from a simple `/src` where you type your code in Typescript files to the processed `/www` where you only have a few optimized `.js` files (meaning these tasks: build, clean, cleancss, copy, lint, minify, sass, watch and more).

* <a name="ionic2-app-base"></a> [ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base) - Base project for Ionic projects. It includes the stuff that when you start a new Ionic apps is identical in all of them, no matter what [starter template](#ionic-starter-templates) is used. This includes the definition which version of `ionic-angular` is actually used in the project, but also all the other dependencies in `package.json`. It adds the default `config.xml` for Cordova projects, the `src/index.html` that loads all the JS, and the `src/app/main.ts` that is the "entry" point of all the code that gets executed. In `/resources` you also get the default app icons and splash screens.

* [ionic-native](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native) - _Ionic Native_ bridges all the Cordova plugins out there into the Ionic and Angular world. It adds a wrapper around the plugin codes that offers Promises and Observables you can use in your code. Additionally it adds Runtime Diagnostics and Browser Usage support, so you can write mocks for the plugins that work during browser testing.

* [ionic-storage](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-storage) - _Ionic Storage_ is a simple key value store made for Ionic, solving many of the storage requirements in common projects. In the background it uses IndexedDB, WebSQL, and LocalStorage and also can use SQLite on native environments where the SQLite Cordova plugin is installed. It uses the excellent [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage) in the background.

* [ionic-module-template](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-module-template) - This template could be the base if you decide to build and distribute a reusable module for Ionic.

### Ionic Starter Templates

These templates are downloaded and applied on top of the [ionic2-app-base](#ionic2-app-base) by the CLI when you `ionic start` a project. They contain mainly the code for the pages (`/src/app` and `/src/pages`), sometimes additional things (like assets, a `package.json` with additional dependencies, providers etc.).
